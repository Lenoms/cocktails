MVP Stuff

- Sorting (alphabetical and grade)
- Make whole thing nicer
- Editing. I think this is one thing we really want. Make whole update form nicer, and allow for 
  partial fields in create form. Like when you click the tick in untried list item it just takes you
  to full update form. I think thats fine. 
- searching
- ingredients

QOL Changes

- Something to look into in the future is image optimisation and lazy loading. If it starts to get too slow to load the 
  tried list.

Database and multi-user plan

- Auth0 Returns a sub in the user object. Can use this to extend app to other users if we want.
  
1. Properly integrate auth0 with the database:
    - Add security rules on add/update/delete
    - Add proper keys and structure. User folder, and give cocktails actual keys not their name.
    - Then with a nice database that we're happy, start thinking about multi-user.

2. Multi user:
    - I'm not sure man. Do we want to try figure out how to make it read only for some people? 
      We have a weird use case where people might not actually want the app for themselves, they
      want to see OUR data. 
      How can we effectively handle this (People wanting their own account as well as read-access to ours)?

QOL Changes

- Security updates on database
- Make info ui nicer?

- Something to look into in the future is image optimisation and lazy loading. If it starts to get too slow to load the 
  tried list.

- filtering UI looks like shit
- Add proper keys to cocktails in db?
- Fix the bug on mobile? where footer floats above bottom
- Fix bug where long notes/ingredients breaks the untried recipe modal

**CONTEXT**
- Need some kind of app context to store filterOn, sortBy, and searchQuery. 
Will make things nicer by not having to pass heaps around. Also will fix filterOn bug

- Scroll height remembering
- More validation on upsert (cant have characters like '.' in title)

- Think theres a bug where filter is on and try to load tried page. DOesn't load
features

Auth0 Returns a sub in the user object. Can use this to extend app to other users if we want.
